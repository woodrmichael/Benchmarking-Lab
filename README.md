* [x] Commit 1 "Rename package"
    - Rename the package to your MSOE woodm
    - Add the `ListBenchmark` class
    - Stub out the two required methods and write JavaDoc comments for each
* [x] Commit 2 "Command Line Input"
  Implement the `main()` method so that it parses the command line input and calls
  the `ListBencmark.runBenchmarks()` method. You do not need to handle exceptions yet.
* [ ] Commit 3 "Private methods for ListBenchmark"
    - Identify private methods for the `ListBenchmark` class needed to complete the assignment
      (used as helper methods to complete the implementation of the two required public methods)
    - Stub out the methods and provide JavaDoc for the methods.
* [ ] Commit 4 "Benchmark Parameters for java.util benchmarks"
    - Implement the remaining requirements for the lab assignment.
    - Fill in values for the benchmarking parameters below for the first four listed (the `?? ?? ?? [??ns]` on each line)
* [ ] Commit 5 "Lab completed"
    - Fill in remaining values for the benchmarking parameters below (the `?? ?? ?? [??ns]` on each line)
    - Remove the dashes on this line when lab 5 is ready to be graded (and commit and push): D-O-N-E-6
